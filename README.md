# Student Teacher Feedback System


This is an online Feedback system implemented using NodeJS and MongoDB.

This project aims to ease the teacher feedback collection system and avoid the unnecessary manual paperwork and the expenditure of faculty time in collecting, checking and compiling feedbacks forms. 

The system conducts feedbacks at various stages in the course and students are kept in loop about the actions taken in response to their feedback.
